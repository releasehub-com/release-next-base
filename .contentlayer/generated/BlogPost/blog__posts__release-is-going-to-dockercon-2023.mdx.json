    "raw": "\nBack-to-school and back-to-conferences! We're excited to announce that Release will be attending [DockerCon 2023](https://www.dockercon.com/) held in-person in Los Angeles this year. As one of the notable tech events in the container industry, DockerCon promises exciting innovations, industry insights, and networking opportunities. Here's what we're looking forward to this year:\n**🐳 Exploring the latest Docker Technology:**   \nDocker reshaped the way we think about, build, and deploy software. DockerCon is an excellent opportunity to learn about new tools, techniques, and best practices, and get a firsthand look at the latest Docker developments. We’re curious to see how these developments might resonate with our initiatives and broader industry landscape.\n**👋 Engaging with the Docker Community:   \n‍**There's nothing like being surrounded by fellow Docker enthusiasts who are just as passionate about containers as we are! DockerCon offers a unique platform to meet experts, share experiences, and foster partnerships. We're excited to exchange insights with fellow attendees and potentially collaborate on future endeavors.\n**📝 Diving into Workshops and Breakout Sessions:  \n‍**DockerCon's workshops are where theory meets practice. We're particularly interested in hands-on sessions that will provide our team with practical knowledge and skills that we can immediately apply to our projects. Check out what one of the Docker Captain has to say about the [upcoming DockerCon workshops](https://www.docker.com/blog/dockercon-workshops-what-to-expect/) and pick a track that makes sense for you.\n**🤓 Sharing Our Own Insights:  \n‍**While we're excited to absorb a ton of new information, we're also thrilled to share our own experiences with the Docker community. Our team has worked on some groundbreaking projects, and we believe our experiences can be valuable to others on their containerization journey. Come see us at the booth or in one of the sessions, just look for a purple Release t-shirt.\n\nDockerCon 2023 promises to be more than just a conference; it's an experience, a learning expedition, and an opportunity to engage with the global container community. We at Release are gearing up for an enlightening few days, and we can't wait to share our learnings and experiences with you once we're back.\n\nP.S. If you're also attending DockerCon 2023, drop us a line! We'd love to catch up and share notes.\n",
