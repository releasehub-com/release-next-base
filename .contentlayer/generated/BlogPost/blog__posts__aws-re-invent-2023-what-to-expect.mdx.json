    "raw": "\nRelease is heading to AWS re:Invent where we will showcase our latest product developments, share previews of upcoming releases, and network with fellow cloud enthusiasts. Come see us at Booth #503 of the Expo Hall for a custom demo and some Release swag.\n\nAs we gear up for [AWS re:Invent 2023](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) in Las Vegas (Nov 27 - Dec 1), here's a concise guide to help you navigate and make the most out of this expansive cloud computing event.\n\n‍**Why Go:**\n\n- **Networking Galore:** With over 60,000 attendees, it's a melting pot of cloud enthusiasts, including developers, system administrators, engineers, and IT execs.\n- **Learning Opportunities:** Expect over 2,000 sessions covering a range of topics from AWS innovations to practical DevOps strategies.\n- **Hands-On Experience:** Interactive sessions like Builders’ Sessions and Workshops are perfect for us to get our hands dirty with real-world AWS applications.\n- ‍**Keynote Insights**: Hear from AWS leaders like CEO Adam Selipsky and CTO Dr. Werner Vogels for the latest AWS developments and future directions. See the full list of keynotes [here](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/keynotes/).\n\n**What to Expect:**\n\n- **Diverse Sessions:** Tailored for various expertise levels, these sessions cover everything from AWS basics to advanced topics in various technologies. Use the [Sessions Catalog](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/) to plan your agenda. The handy filter on the left side sorts by topic, complexity, and even your role.\n- **Expo Hall:** A great place to see live demos and discuss with AWS partners about their latest solutions. Find Release at Booth #503 of the [Expo](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/expo).\n- **After-Hours Fun:** Don’t miss the [re:Play](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/community/replay) party for some downtime. Las Vegas itself offers a plethora of entertainment options to unwind.\n\n‍**Practical Tips:**\n\n- **Early Arrival:** Consider arriving a day early to settle in and maybe explore Vegas.\n- **Hotel Choices:** Take advantage of special rates for attendees. Options range from the luxury of Encore to the unique ambiance of The Venetian.\n- **Getting Around:** Free campus shuttles and monorail services are available for easy movement between venues.\n\n‍**Maximizing Your Experience:**\n\n- **Set Clear Goals:** The event can be overwhelming, so deciding what you want to achieve up-front can help. Whether it's learning, networking, or exploring business opportunities, set a few goals and set some time aside for exploration.\n- **Leverage Event Intelligence:** Use tools (e.g. AWS events app) to get insights on attendees and sessions. Many things will be happening at the same time, so jotting down a custom agenda will help you navigate the event.\n- **Post-Event Follow-Up:** Reflect on your interactions and plan follow-ups to maintain the momentum.\n\n‍**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAWS re:Invent 2023 isn't just another tech conference; it's one of the largest outlets for anyone in the cloud computing and DevOps space to engage. It's an opportunity to stay ahead in the industry, learn from the best, and make connections that matter.\n\nSee you in Vegas!\n",
