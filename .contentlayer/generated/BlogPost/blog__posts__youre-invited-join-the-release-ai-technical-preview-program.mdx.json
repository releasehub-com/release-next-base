    "raw": "\nToday we are excited to launch the Release.ai Technical Preview Program, aimed at simplifying infrastructure management for AI workloads. We’ve spoken with teams doing incredible work in AI, from building new foundational models to integrating custom trained models into products, and one thing is clear, the infrastructure is lagging behind. All across the industry we see amazing innovations pop up every week (as I’m writing this [Cognition AI is blowing up the internet with their Devin assistant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/cognition-ai-is-a-peter-thiel-backed-coding-assistant)), and underneath the surface to make all this happen are infrastructure teams toiling away at accumulating GPUs, managing finicky clusters, investigating the latest timeouts, and making their finance folks bug-eyed at the bills being generated.\n\n[Release](http://release.com) is a leader in abstracting away infrastructure complexity for conventional SDLC processes, so that engineering teams can focus on shipping high quality products, faster. Now we are bringing that expertise to support AI engineering teams. To begin, we partnered with NVIDIA to simplify the setup and management of the NeMo framework infrastructure. Now you can use NeMo and Release to build and deploy models in a portable and cloud agnostic way on top of Kubernetes clusters we manage for you.\n\nWhile Release.ai simplifies AI infrastructure, you don’t have to choose between simplicity and control - everything on Release.ai is orchestrated in your cloud account on hardware that you own, simplifying toil while maintaining control. Currently we support training, fine-tuning, and inference workflows with more workflows and supported frameworks to come in the near future. \n\nWe opened access to our beta program for teams who build, fine tune and train AI models. Come build a new AI Infrastructure platform with us!\n\n[Sign up for Release.ai today!](https://release.ai/)\n",
