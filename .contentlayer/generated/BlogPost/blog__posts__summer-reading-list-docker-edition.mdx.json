    "raw": "\nHow are you spending the last days of summer? How about taking a few minutes to brush up on your Docker knowledge? As we prepare for the [DockerCon](https://www.dockercon.com/) conference later this fall, we wanted to get you up-to-speed on all things Docker.\n\nThis installment of the Summer Reading List highlights five especially popular Docker articles that help you understand and troubleshoot Docker challenges. Read on and let us know if you have other favorite Docker resources we could learn from.\n\n#### 🐳 [Creating your first Application in Release with Docker Compose](https://release.com/blog/creating-your-first-application-in-release-with-docker-compose)\n\nLearn how to migrate applications from Docker Compose to Kubernetes using Release. This step-by-step guide shows how to analyze a Compose file, generate an Application Template, set environment variables and build arguments, and deploy an application. Part two the series will cover deployment specifics and Kubernetes objects.\n\n#### 🐳 [How to set Docker Compose Environment Variables](https://release.com/blog/how-to-set-docker-compose-environment-variables)\n\nThis practical guide to managing environment variables in Docker Compose shows you how to define variables in the Compose file, pass variables from the host machine, or store them using a `.env` file. It also explains the priority of variables, offers best practices for handling sensitive data, and goes over solution for secure and efficient environment management.\n\n#### 🐳 [6 Docker Compose Best Practices for Dev and Prod](https://release.com/blog/6-docker-compose-best-practices-for-dev-and-prod)\n\nExplore Docker Compose best practices for both development and production environments. Learn how to use Docker Compose to manage multi-container Docker applications effectively, and get tips on mounting code as a volume, using override files, employing YAML anchors for sharing settings, and configuring CPU and memory limits.\n\n#### 🐳 [How to edit a file in a Docker container](https://release.com/blog/how-to-edit-a-file-in-a-docker-container)\n\nThis hands-on guide explains how to edit files in Docker containers, addressing the lack of preinstalled file editors like Vim or Nano. It offers two methods: editing from the command line and using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Docker extension. The guide emphasizes best practices, including removing unnecessary packages after editing and persisting an editor in the Dockerfile for frequent changes. It also highlights the importance of saving new images after making changes for testing and consistency.\n\n#### 🐳 [Cutting Build Time In Half with Docker’s Buildx Kubernetes Driver](https://release.com/blog/cutting-build-time-in-half-docker-buildx-kubernetes)\n\nFollow along on our journey to improve our build infrastructure by implementing Docker's buildx project. When we faced challenges with slow build times and concurrency bottlenecks in our build process, we turned to buildx, to speed-up both our cached and uncached builds. This blog covers our infrastructure setup and how buildx's features like parallelism, Kubernetes driver, and load balancing helped us optimize our Docker image building process, ultimately benefiting our service delivery and customer experiences.\n\nThis concludes our Docker Summer Reading List.
