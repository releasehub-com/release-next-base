    "raw": "\n**February 24, 2022** – Release today announced that Kelsey DeGeorge has been appointed as Chief Revenue Officer. DeGeorge joins Release from Amazon Web Services, where she led a sales segment dedicated to B2B ISV companies, supporting them as consumers of AWS technology while forming joint GTM partnerships. DeGeorge will be responsible for scaling the GTM organization by accelerating Release adoption, elevating Release’s visibility through the channel, including cloud partner programs, and connecting with hundreds of thousands of developers on AWS who use conventional environments today. She will report directly to Release CEO and co-founder Tommy McClung.\n\n“Hiring Kelsey is a major milestone for Release,” said Tommy McClung, Release co-founder and CEO. “We immediately recognized her unmatched knowledge of the software vendor market and her deep insights into how companies can build GTM partnerships with cloud providers, an influential channel strategy in the industry. She is intimately familiar with the challenges ISVs face, and her skillset is the perfect match as we ramp up for the next phase of growth.”\n\nRelease provides Environments-as-a-Service to software developers, easing a significant bottleneck in software production. Developers frequently wait for access to limited environments, costing the software industry $45 billion annually. Having access to Environments-as-a-Service empowers developers to create cloud native full-stack environments on-demand, which can be used for quality analysis, running production applications and delivering software to customers on virtual private clouds or public clouds like AWS.\n\n“I was introduced to Release during my time at AWS and recognized the opportunity that their novel Environments-as-a-Service platform provides,” said DeGeorge. “They’ve created a unique technology with significant growth potential. It’s a rare opportunity to join such an innovative company at the startup stage, and I’m thrilled to be part of the team.”\n\nPrior to joining Release and AWS, DeGeorge held gtm and engineering roles at PTC, Schlumberger, and RealID. She has a BS in Mechanical Engineering from University of Colorado, and is involved in the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and the Lunar University Network for Astrophysics Research (LUNAR).\n",
