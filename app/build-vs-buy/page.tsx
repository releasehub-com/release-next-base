        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          When it comes to environment management, organizations face a critical
          decision: build an in-house solution or buy an existing platform. This
          choice impacts development velocity, resource allocation, and
          long-term costs.

          Building In-House
        </h2>

        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Building an in-house solution gives you complete control over the
          implementation and features. However, it requires significant
          investment in both time and resources. Your team needs to develop
          expertise in infrastructure automation, maintain the system, and
          continuously evolve it as your needs change.
