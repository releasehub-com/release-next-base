**SAN FRANCISCO, September 29, 2022** — Release, the leading provider of on-demand software environments, today announced that TripActions, an industry-leading all-in-one travel, corporate card, and expense management solution, has selected ReleaseHub to provide its developers with ephemeral, full-stack staging environments that can be spun up and down on demand.

‍

Switching to Release’s on-demand staging environments will allow TripActions to stand up and tear down identical production-like environments instantly, eliminating common delays that developers across all industries experience with conventional shared environments. With ReleaseHub, organizations reduce the cost of wasted developer time, and increase operational efficiency and productivity.

‍

“Developers around the world understand how frustrating and pervasive staging environment delays are,” said Tommy McClung, co-founder and CEO of Release. “TripActions is in a unique position because they’re an industry leader at the cutting edge of innovation, with thousands of global customers, so they have unparalleled insight into developer pain points. Delays frequently leave the most talented, highly-paid professionals stuck waiting in limbo. Our ephemeral environments eliminate the limbo time entirely.”

‍

With Release, organizations — including TripActions — can also focus on attracting and retaining the highest quality professionals by removing staging delays, a continual source of frustration for developers across all industries.

‍

“Release will enable us to increase our release cadence and reduce developer down-time,” said Chris Willmore, director of productivity engineering at TripActions. “We have hundreds of developers and if they are using conventional shared staging environments, many end up sitting around, waiting for access. Release eliminates the waiting time, improves developer flow, saves wasted resources, and helps us deliver software faster.”

‍

Release delivers Environments-as-a-Service using environments-as-code. Unlike other solutions, ReleaseHub abstracts away much of the work required by developers. The process of creating environments-as-code is automated and customizable. The result allows developers to manage environments simply via code in their development workflow. ReleaseHub supports running custom Infrastructure-as-a-Code including Terraform, Helm and other Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers.
