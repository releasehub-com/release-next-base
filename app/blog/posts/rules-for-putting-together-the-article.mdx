## 1 - The article should ALWAYS start with a paragraph or a heading H2

Otherwise the body of the post will be misaligned with the social block

### 2 - The H1 should never be used, because this tag is reserved for the blog title

It's bad for SEO having two or more H1 in the same page

### 3 - It's not needed to add bold to the for the headings, because the weight is already set for the headings.

#### Otherwise the headings will look like this: **Heading bold**

### 4 - It's not needed to add extra space between the paragraphs

It is not necessary to use space between paragraphs as they already have a defined margin.

Adding extra spaces will leave your text with excess space, as we can see below.

Can you see? I told you

### 5 - When working with the block codes it's important to pay attention to spacing

```yaml
  readiness_probe:
    exec:
      command:
      - curl
      - "-Lf"
      - http://localhost
    failure_threshold: 5
    period_seconds: 30
    timeout_seconds: 3

```

_If you add a description for the blog, make it italic._

### 6 - When you add an image there is no need to add empty lines above and/or below the image, the image itself is already spacing defined.

Here's how you won't need to add a line between the paragraph and the image:

![](/blog-images/9e8bd025d7f442e799770734b97fc833.png)

Image description

It will be perfect even if you don't have a description for the image, don't worry.

But see below that if you have an empty line it will create non-harmonious spacing between the paragraph and the image

### 7 - Take care to always end your article without empty lines at the end, as this will generate empty space at the end of the article.

### 8 - The proper way to write inline code block:

<code inline>release instances terminal</code>
