Tommy McClung is featured on a DevOps.com [webinar](https://webinars.devops.com/continuous-deployment?utm_campaign=%242022.07.11%24_EdCal_Panel_Webinar_DO&utm_source=Release) to discuss the ins and outs of Continuous Deployment.  He is joined by Field CTO of Harness and Senior Director of Engineering at Everbridge as they dive into the challenges of CD.

Tommy, the co-founder and CEO of Release, has been building scalable infrastructure for at least over 20 years. He’s also a serial entrepreneur. He co-founded CarWoo!, which was acquired by TrueCar.

It’s no secret that continuous deployment is challenging, because automating deployments across platforms has never been especially easy. Continuous Deployment also implies that you know where everything is being deployed into and you have environments that are stood up.  Often platforms are customized to the point where it is difficult to automate application deployments—each platform is its own unique "snowflake."

However, the growing complexity of application development projects coupled with increased reliance on software to drive digital business transformation initiatives and concerns over software supply chain integrity requires organizations to revisit their approach to application delivery.

Tommy has been working on this problem for many years. As a developer at heart, he cares about getting great ideas to the world quickly, and environments tend to be a key ingredient in making that happen. This is why he created ReleaseHub and the concept of ephemeral environments, or “environments as a service”. With ReleaseHub, developers can create on demand environments with the click of a button or via a pull request, while maintaining robust velocity and faster deployment.

If you’re looking to have some burning questions answered such as “How automated can CD get?” or “How do DevOps teams roll things back when something goes wrong?”, you’re in the right place.  Tommy, along with his fellow speakers answer these questions along with many others.
