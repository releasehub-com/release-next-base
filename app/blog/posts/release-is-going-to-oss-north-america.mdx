Come see us at [Open Source Summit North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) in Vancouver, Canada this week! We are excited to be attending the conference, hearing amazing talks, and seeing all the cool things the community is working on. This year we are showing off our own open source project “gromit” and are demoing the improvements we made to our Release Development Platform.

Here at Release we are strong believers in the power of open source. In our drive to create a development platform that better serves modern development teams, our founding team has been using and contributing to the open source community for years. Founded in 2019 Release was and still is built entirely with open source software! 

This year, we are excited to announce a contribution to the open source community that allows anyone to take their documentation and create an AI powered assistant. Based on the work done at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/chatgpt-supabase-docs) to create a ChatGPT user interface for documentation, Release is open sourcing [a ruby gem “gromit”](https://rubygems.org/gems/gromit) that provides a vector search backend using Ruby and Redis.

Our vision at Release is for all developers and teams to use the cloud to its full potential without needing to be experts in everything. We do this by simplifying the creation, access and usage of all environments (development, ephemeral, testing, staging, production, etc.), while maintaining access to advanced tooling.

If you are looking for ways to increase developer productivity through a truly modern cloud agnostic platform or just want to see a cool demo of “gromit” in action come see us at our booth! We love chatting with developers, learning about their successes and challenges (comparing notes) and making teams as productive as possible.  See you there!
