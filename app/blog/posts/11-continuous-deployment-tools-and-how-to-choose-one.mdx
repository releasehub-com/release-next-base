The popularity of agile methodologies among businesses has escalated and resulted in the mass adoption of continuous software development processes. This has given rise to many tools that make implementing your DevOps pipeline and application development easier. Choosing which tool to use to produce a robust system is difficult because of the market surge in continuous deployment tools. 

Continuous deployment (CD) is the procedure whereby updates to software code are pipelined, automated, tested, and then made available in the production environment. It is a crucial stage in the DevOps life cycle and assists companies in quickly and efficiently deploying changes, upgrades, and updates at the app level. 

In this article, I'll outline 11 continuous deployment tools that you should consider for deployment processes in your DevOps pipeline. We’ll look at the features and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each tool. I'll talk about how these technologies may be utilized in DevOps, and finally, we’ll look at a comparison of these tools in detail.

#### Which Tools Can Be Used for Continuous Deployment in DevOps?

The final phase in a DevOps pipeline is deployment, and to accomplish CD (continuous deployment), the whole pipeline must have been correctly automated (build, testing, and staging). Deciding a preferred CD tool for the system depends on the scale and sensitivity of the project, as well as what features you look to achieve in your DevOps pipeline. 

Here is a comparison of these top 11 continuous deployment tools discussed in this article.
