Release.ai is an orchestration and infrastructure management platform for custom AI applications. We handle the complex backend work, allowing developers and data scientists to focus on innovation. Our self-service platform provides powerful building blocks that simplify AI development and deployment, enabling teams to create advanced applications more efficiently.

We are excited to announce the addition of Docker's GenAI Stack to our library of pre-configured templates, simplifying AI application development and deployment. The Docker GenAI Stack serves as a comprehensive template for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, allowing developers to quickly set up and experiment with AI-powered systems on their local machines. This collaboration combines Docker's containerization expertise with Release.ai's cloud deployment capabilities, enabling a seamless transition from local development to cloud-based production. With Release.ai, deploying your Docker GenAI Stack to the cloud becomes as straightforward as running it locally, offering developers a streamlined solution for building and scaling AI applications without the complexity typically associated with cloud infrastructure management.

"By integrating Docker's GenAI Stack, we're helping developers spend more time on innovation and less on infrastructure setup." explains Tommy McClung, Release founder.

Key benefits of this collaboration include:

- **Simplified Deployment:** With just a few clicks, developers can create a fully functional GenAI environment, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
- **Time Savings:** Early adopters report cutting setup time by up to 50%, allowing teams to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.
- **Standardization:** The template ensures consistency across different projects and teams, improving collaboration and reducing potential issues.
- **Scalability:** Release.ai's managed Kubernetes infrastructure provides the ability to easily scale AI applications as needed.

There are several Docker GenAI Stack templates on Release.ai:

- Ollama, LangChain, Neo4j, with Open Source Models (default llama3:8b)
- Ollama, LangChain, Chroma, with Open Source Models (default llama3:8b)
- Ollama, LangChain, Chroma, with OpenAI

Docker and Release partnership represents a significant step forward in democratizing advanced AI technologies. Simplifying the deployment process opens up new possibilities for innovation across various industries. Looking ahead, we plan to expand the collaboration to integrate more AI-focused templates and explore ways to optimize AI workflows further.
