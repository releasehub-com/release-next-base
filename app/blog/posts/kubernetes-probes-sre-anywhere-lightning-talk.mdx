It was my pleasure to present a five minute lighting talk at the [Catchpoint SREÂ from Anywhere](https://www.catchpoint.com/sre/from-anywhere-2021) virtual conference on June 10, 2021. You can see the video presentation which was based on my earlier blog post on [Kubernetes probes](https://releasehub.com/blog/kubernetes-health-checks-2-ways-to-improve-stability).
