We’re excited to [announce that Release has joined the NVIDIA Inception Partner Program.](/press-releases/release-joins-nvidia-inception-to-bring-ai-environments-tailored-for-nvidia-stack-and-gpus) The NVIDIA Inception program is an ecosystem of startups working on AI and data science with NVIDIA GPUs. As developer and data science teams begin to build applications and train data sets with NVIDIA NeMo and GPUs, [environments as a service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKajKw7-Ajs) is a perfect complement to the success and speed of teams wanting to focus on data insights, not complex infrastructure.

As an Inception Partner, we are working closely with NVIDIA to make sure we are delivering the right capabilities to teams using NVIDIA GPUs and their data science and AI/ML stacks. NVIDIA is the latest partnership for Release, which spans the entire application delivery and deployment lifecycle. We’re committed to integrations with all of the tools our customers use, from repositories and CI/CD tooling to cloud platform vendors and consulting services. 

But why does this matter to you? For starters, it means seamless integration with your preferred cloud platform, ensuring optimal performance without any compatibility headaches. Additionally, our partnerships provide access to valuable resources and support, streamlining deployment and troubleshooting. And let's not forget about staying at the forefront of innovation – with our connections, you'll always be in tune with the latest advancements and trends in technology. 

Along with NVIDIA, Release is working with companies like:
*   AWS
*   Google Cloud Platform
*   Docker
*   Tonic
*   Codingscape
