Managing secrets securely is essential for any modern application infrastructure, and integrating [Doppler Secrets Manager](https://www.doppler.com/) with Release can streamline this process. This guide covers how to set up and configure Doppler to work seamlessly with your Release environments, providing a reliable and scalable way to manage secrets across various services and jobs.

### **What is Doppler Secrets Manager?**

Doppler Secrets Manager provides a secure, centralized way to manage and inject sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, into your applications. Through the integration of Doppler and Release, you can ensure that these secrets are securely synchronized with your Kubernetes clusters in Release environments.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you dive into the setup, make sure you have the following ready:
*   **Access to a Release environment** with configured Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Release CLI** installed and configured on your local machine.
*   **Doppler account** with generated service tokens that have the necessary permissions.

### **Integrating Doppler with Release**

Let's walk through the steps to securely manage secrets using Doppler in your Release environment.

#### **Step 1: Set Up Kubeconfig for Your Release Cluster**

First, you'll need to configure your kubeconfig to access the Release cluster. This will allow kubectl to interact with your Release environment directly.

Run the following commands to generate and configure kubeconfig:
**bash**

```bash

release clusters kubeconfig --account Release --cluster release-development ./export KUBECONFIG=./config-release-development.yaml

```

With this, the kubeconfig for your Release cluster is now set as the current context for kubectl.

#### **Step 2: Install the Doppler Kubernetes Operator**

The Doppler Kubernetes Operator is responsible for syncing secrets from Doppler to your Kubernetes environment. To install it, start by adding the Doppler Helm repository and installing the operator:
**bash**

```bash

helm repo add doppler https://helm.doppler.comhelm install --generate-name doppler/doppler-kubernetes-operator

```

This setup deploys the Doppler Kubernetes Operator, ready to securely synchronize secrets.

#### **Step 3: Create a Doppler Token Secret in Kubernetes**

To allow the Doppler Operator access to your secrets, you’ll need to create a Kubernetes secret with your Doppler service token. Replace YOUR\_DOPPLER\_SERVICE\_TOKEN with the actual token from your Doppler account.
**bash**

```bash

kubectl create secret generic doppler-token-secret \  --namespace doppler-operator-system \  --from-literal=serviceToken=YOUR_DOPPLER_SERVICE_TOKEN

```

With this token in place, the Doppler Operator can access and synchronize secrets into your Kubernetes environment.

#### **Step 4: Configure Your Release Application to Use Doppler Secrets**

Now, configure your application in Release to use these Doppler-managed secrets. Begin by defining the secrets you need in Doppler, associating each set with a specific Doppler project and configuration. In Release, link these secrets to your services using the secrets\_from field within the service configuration. This enables each service to access only the secrets it needs, ensuring secure, targeted access.

For example, you can define separate secret configurations for a Rails and an AI project:
**yaml**

```yaml

secrets:
  - name: development
    type: doppler
    project: rails
    config: dev
  - name: development-ai
    type: doppler
    project: ai
    config: dev

```

`‍`‍

Next, associate these secrets with the respective services in Release:
**yaml**

```yaml

services:
  - name: rails
    image: github-org/rails
    secrets_from:
      - development
  - name: ai-chatbot
    image: github-org/ai-chatbot
    secrets_from:
      - development-ai
jobs:
  - name: chatbot-setup
    image: github-org/rails
    secrets_from:
      - development
      - development-ai
    steps:
      - run: bundle exec rake chatbot:setup

```

In this setup:
*   The **Rails service** pulls the development secrets from the Rails project in Doppler.
*   The **AI chatbot service** accesses the development-ai secrets from the AI project in Doppler.

This configuration keeps secrets streamlined and service-specific, enhancing security and simplifying secret management across your environments.

### **Troubleshooting Doppler Secrets Synchronization Issues**

If you encounter issues accessing secrets, you can view the Doppler operator logs to diagnose and resolve synchronization issues:
**bash**

```bash

kubectl logs -f deployment/doppler-operator-controller-manager -n doppler-operator-system

```

This command lets you track the Doppler operator's logs for any potential issues. Common errors include incorrect service account permissions, invalid service tokens, or misconfigured Doppler projects and configurations.

## Conclusion

Integrating Doppler with Release provides a robust, scalable solution for managing secrets in Kubernetes. By following these steps, you can securely manage secrets across multiple services, enhancing security and maintaining control over sensitive data in your Release environments. With Doppler Secrets Manager, Release environments become even more secure and manageable, empowering development teams to focus on building rather than managing configurations.
