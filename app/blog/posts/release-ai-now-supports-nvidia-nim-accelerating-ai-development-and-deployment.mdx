Release.ai is an orchestration and infrastructure management platform for custom AI applications. We handle the complex backend work, allowing developers and data scientists to focus on innovation. Our self-service platform provides powerful building blocks that simplify AI development and deployment, enabling teams to create advanced applications more efficiently.

We're excited to announce that Release.ai now supports NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices), further enhancing our AI development capabilities. As a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, we're bringing powerful, easy-to-deploy AI functionalities to developers while minimizing the complexities of AI infrastructure management.

‍
**Simplifying AI Development with NIM**

NVIDIA NIM offers a set of easy-to-use inference microservices that streamline the deployment of foundation models. By integrating NIM into our platform, Release.ai is making it simpler than ever for teams to leverage NVIDIA's AI technologies in their projects.

‍
**Out-of-the-box templates for NVIDIA GPUs**

Release.ai now offers pre-configured templates optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and the NIM framework. These templates dramatically reduce setup time and learning curves, allowing developers to skip the tedious configuration process and jump straight into AI development. With our ever-growing library of the latest models and frameworks, you can start using NVIDIA NIM without navigating a complex setup process. With a ready-to-run NIM framework (along with the NeMo framework included in Release.ai), developers can quickly spin up an environment with the essential AI tools, build and deploy with confidence.

‍

‍**Effortless NIM Deployment and Management**

With Release.ai, deploying and managing NIM is streamlined:

1\. Select a NIM-ready template

2\. Launch your AI environment with a few clicks

3\. Let Release.ai handle the ongoing management of your NIM infrastructure

Our platform takes care of provisioning resources based on your team and application needs, and even auto-scales resources as your application demands change.

‍
**AI Lifecycle Workflows**

Release.ai goes beyond just spinning up NIM environments. Our platform provides tools to develop, debug, and manage the entire lifecycle of your AI applications. You can create custom workflows to streamline your development process, easily import AI apps into ephemeral environments, and scale efficiently with proper governance in place.

‍

‍**Maximizing ROI on AI Infrastructure**

By leveraging Release.ai for your NVIDIA NIM deployments, you can:

\- **Save Money:** Optimize your compute spend with intelligent resource management

\- **Save Time:** Minimize setup effort and focus on building AI applications

\- **Scale Efficiently:** Grow your AI initiatives with automated, governed processes

\- **Keep Data Private:** Maintain full control over your data, models, and infrastructure

‍
**The Power of the NVIDIA Inception Program**

As a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, Release.ai is at the forefront of AI innovation. This partnership allows us to work closely with NVIDIA, ensuring we deliver the right capabilities to teams using NVIDIA GPUs and their data science and AI/ML stacks.

‍
**What's Next: Community Templates and Beyond**

Stay tuned for our upcoming community templates, which will allow developers to share and use custom NIM configurations. This feature will further accelerate AI development by leveraging collective expertise.

‍
**Getting Started**

Whether you're building large language models, working on computer vision projects, or exploring other AI applications, Release.ai with NVIDIA NIM support provides the easiest way for teams to accelerate their AI development journey.
