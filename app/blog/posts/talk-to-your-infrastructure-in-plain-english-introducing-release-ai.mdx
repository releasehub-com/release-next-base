The wait(list) is over. Release AI is now available to everyone, and for a limited time it’s absolutely free. I am thrilled to share this innovative AI tool designed to redefine the way you build and deliver applications so you can experience our context-aware Release AI, directly through your CLI. Join our launch community, and share your feedback that will shape the feature roadmap of Release AI.

Sign up for your free account [here](https://beta.release.com/ai/register) and let us know what you think.  

Release helps teams release their ideas to the world faster. For developers like you, it means spinning up ephemeral environments in seconds and seeing exactly how your app will perform in production, or using production-like data to test your creations under real loads. With Release AI it also means getting all your infrastructure questions answered without relying on the limited resources of your DevOps team. Originally, DevOps was meant to empower developers with operational tasks, but instead it turned into an additional hurdle on the path to delivering product features quickly.

Release AI lets you tap into the information needed to deploy and release your ideas to the world. Now you don’t need to track down your go-to DevOps engineer and wait for them to run complex queries to answer questions like:

- What's going on in my AWS account?
- How is it configured?
- How is my Kubernetes cluster setup?
- Are pods crashing?
- What are the IP addresses of my instances?
- What was the bill in my AWS account yesterday?

What used to take hours or days to figure out, is now available directly in your command line. With Release AI you can talk to your underlying infrastructure in plain English and have it perform complex tasks with your context in mind. You can even schedule tasks, so you can ask these questions on a recurring basis and get the result delivered to you automatically.  This removes a bottleneck in your ability to deliver software faster, and gets the DevOps out of the business of being highly paid developer support engineers.

To get started, [sign up for a Release AI account](https://beta.release.com/ai/register) and follow the steps in our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.release.com/release-ai/quickstart) to get up and running. [Join our Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/release-ai/shared_invite/zt-20dxgp2o0-ePCXzsag6l8_i4HwOgRItg) to stay up to date on new developments and share your insights. Make sure to check our [docs](https://docs.release.com/release-ai/introduction) for more details on how Release AI works, to get sample prompts and to see advanced configurations.

We believe Release AI has the potential to transform the way you work, empowering you to achieve new levels of efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. However, we cannot accomplish this alone. Your expertise and feedback are invaluable in shaping the future of Release AI, and ensuring that it genuinely caters to the needs of professionals like you. Join us for this preview phase, available free for all Release users via the CLI.
