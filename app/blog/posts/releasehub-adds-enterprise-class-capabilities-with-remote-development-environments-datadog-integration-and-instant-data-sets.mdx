**San Fransisco, CA** —  **October 24, 2022** — Release, the leading provider of Environments-as-a-Service (EaaS), today announced enterprise class technologies for remote development environments, Datadog integration, and instant data management to improve developer confidence and increase release velocity. The company also announced it hired Matt Carter, former Docker Vice President of Marketing, as CMO.

‍

“This is the era of Environments as a Service, which is driving fundamental changes throughout the application development process,” said Tommy McClung, Release CEO. “Our goal is to provide developers with the ability to write and commit code without penalty. With ReleaseHub, developers can spin up identical copies of environments as needed, within minutes.”

‍

One of the biggest bottlenecks in software delivery happens when developers are stuck waiting for access to environments. This results in significant delays in testing, debugging, and deploying software. EaaS mimics true production environments but are spun up and down on demand, so developers avoid development paralysis.

‍

EaaS signals a leap in release velocity and developer confidence. Similar to how containers let developers isolate software code, EaaS frees developers from fixed environments, letting them move quickly, at low cost, and without disrupting the workflow of their team.

‍

“We’re seeing greater EaaS uptake as developer teams recognize traditional environments are a major bottleneck,” said Matt Carter, Release CMO. “I’ve worked at Microsoft, Chef, and Docker, and have seen many technology transitions over the years. As we add more enterprise-class features, we’re seeing similar growth now, with greater adoption among a wider range of organizations.”

‍

Additionally, Release announced a number of new features that extend EaaS platform value to application development teams, including:

‍
*   **Remote Development Environments**

Release is improving release velocity with new technology that lets developers build code locally while running it remotely within a customer’s cloud account. Remote development environments increase release velocity by letting developers use their full stack, while receiving immediate feedback from production or production-like data in their development environment.

‍
*   **Datadog Integration**

ReleaseHub is introducing native support for Datadog, enabling developers to work from the leading cloud monitoring platform. Datadog observability gives developers Release insights from their Datadog accounts as well as single sign-on, role-based access control, and secrets management within ReleaseHub. These enterprise class features help organizations manage their DevOps pipelines at scale.

‍
*   **Instant Data Sets**

Release is accelerating the replication of application data with Instant Data Sets, which lets developers create a replica of application data in minutes. Developers can build and test against the actual data their app uses.

‍
**About Release**

Release delivers Environments-as-a-Service. It lets developers easily share progress with stakeholders when a full stack environment is created with every pull request and is shareable via custom URLs and directly in Slack. Every environment is a full instance of the app with all its services. ReleaseHub was funded by CRV, Sequoia, Y Combinator, Bow Capital, Artisanal Ventures, Hack VC, and other investors.
