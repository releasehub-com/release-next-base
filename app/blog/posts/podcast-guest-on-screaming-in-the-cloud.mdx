I had the pleasure of reconnecting with Corey Quinn on his excellent podcast, [“Screaming in the Cloud”](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/). The far-ranging topics wandered working together at a company, to discussing how far internet technology has developed, to changing jobs in the middle of a pandemic, to what we do at Release. You can view the full episode and transcript [here](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/reconnecting-with-an-old-boss-with-regis-wilson/).
